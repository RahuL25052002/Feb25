Snippet 20:
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World")
	}
}
ï‚· What syntax error occurs?
	we not write the Semicolon(;) after SOP statement
	that give this error then 


 How does the missing semicolon affect compilation?
	compiler cannot decide end Of statement where it is
	it is say that after the statement you compulsory add 
	semicolon to that statement

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World");
	}
}
