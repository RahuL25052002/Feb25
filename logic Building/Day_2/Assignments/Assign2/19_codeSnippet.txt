Snippet 19:
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 10;
		int b = 0;
		int result = a / b;
		System.out.println(result);
	}
}
ï‚· What runtime exception is thrown?

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
        at Main.main(Main.java:5)

 Why does division by zero cause an issue in Java?

 because when we divide any value by zero is answer is infinity 
thats why it impossible to show that why it gave an error

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 10;
		int b = 0;
		if(b!=0)
			int result = a / b;
		else
			System.out.println("We cannot divide");

		System.out.println(result);
	}
}
