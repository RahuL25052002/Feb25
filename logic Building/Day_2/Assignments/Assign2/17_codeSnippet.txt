Snippet 17:
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 10;
		int b = 5;
		int result = a ** b;
		System.out.println(result);
	}
}
ï‚· What compilation error occurs?

error: illegal start of expression
                int result = a ** b;

 Why is the ** operator not valid in Java?
	because java have not design in that way that 
	supports it and it have no meaning in that


corrected code

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 10;
		int b = 5;
		int result = a * b;
		System.out.println(result);
	}
}
