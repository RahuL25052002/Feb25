public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}	
}

Error :-
 Main method is  not found in class 
we have to declare main method as public in that 



corrected code :

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}	
}
