Snippet 8:
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!"
	}
}
ï‚· What syntax errors are present? 
	We have not closing the bracket of println (method) statement
	thats why it gave an syntax error

How do they affect compilation?
	compiler check all the code syntax if it is not in format
	it gave an error and also .class file not generate 
	it preventing the running of that program.


public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
}
