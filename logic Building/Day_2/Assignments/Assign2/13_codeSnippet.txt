Snippet 13:
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String str = null;
		System.out.println(str.length());
	}
}
ï‚· What exception is thrown? 
	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
        at Main.main(Main.java:4)

Why does it occur?
	if we initialise string with null then it means have nothing 
	in it we cannot access its length 
	if its nothing then how it can be accessed null value has nothing
	thats why it gave an exception
