Snippet 4:
public class Main {
	public static void main() {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
}
ï‚· What happens when you compile and run this code? Why is String[] args needed?

it gave an error as 
 Main method not found in class Main, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application

we have to write in a standard way that method is public , static and void 

Why is String[] args needed?

for command line argument it is used that String array


public class Main {
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
}
