Snippet 11:
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
		System.out.println(arr[5]);
	}
}
What runtime exception do you encounter? 

	"main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
 	Index 5 out of bounds for length 3
	it say that you accessing element out of the length
	of that array

Why does it occur?

	it that you accessing element out of the length
	of that array and in memory some different program also run 
	it has different address if we accessing out of that 
	another data can be accessed by thats why it gave an exception
	to avoid the accesing data

corrected code
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
		System.out.println(arr[0]);
	}
}
