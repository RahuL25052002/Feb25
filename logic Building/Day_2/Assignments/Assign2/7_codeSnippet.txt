Snippet 7:
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x = "Hello";
		System.out.println(x);
	}
}
ï‚· What compilation error do you see? 

	It gave an error that String cannot be converted to int data (incompatible type)

Why does Java enforce type safety?

	programs are prevented from accessing memory in inappropriate ways.

corrected code:

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x =3;// i change string value to integer then it will work
		System.out.println(x);
	}
}
