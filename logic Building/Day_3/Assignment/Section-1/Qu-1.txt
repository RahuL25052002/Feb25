Snippet 1:
public class InfiniteForLoop {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i--) {
			System.out.println(i);
		}
}
}
// Error to investigate:

 Why does this loop run infinitely?
	As in the program initialize with zero (0) and in condition
	i is less than  10  means 0<10 that is true then it goes to body 
	execute body and going to inc/decrement  here is write i--
	means it can -1 value from it -1<10 is true so  the
	here decrement operation is done thats why it goes on  loopp
		

 How should the loop control variable be adjusted?
	we have to check condition according to that we have to perform
	operation  on it 

corrected code

public class InfiniteForLoop {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			System.out.println(i);
		}
	}
}

in this output it will print 0 to 9 and then i=10 then condtion get  false
10<10 loop wiil break
