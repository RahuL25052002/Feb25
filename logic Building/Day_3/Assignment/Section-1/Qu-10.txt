Snippet 10:
public class IncorrectWhileLoopControl {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num = 10;
		while (num = 10) {
			System.out.println(num);
			num--;
		}
	}
}
// Error to investigate: Why does the loop execute indefinitely? What is wrong with the loop condition?

	as we see there in condition we  assign  value  num=10, where 
	it  need the Boolean value but it get the integer value,
	so thats why it get an error expected Boolean got an integer
	so we have use == or !== or < ,> ,<= and >= sign then we get 
	the answer correct
	


corrected code :
	it will run upto the 1 to 10
public class IncorrectWhileLoopControl {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num = 1;
		while (num <= 10) {
			System.out.println(num);
			num++;
		}
	}
}
