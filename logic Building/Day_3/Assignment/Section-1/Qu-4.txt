Snippet 4:
public class OffByOneErrorForLoop {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
			System.out.println(i);
		}

		// Expected: 10 iterations with numbers 1 to 10
		// Actual: Prints numbers 1 to 10, but the task expected only 1 to 9
	}
}
// Error to investigate: What is the issue with the loop boundaries? How should the loop be adjusted to meet the
expected output?

	as the condtion is i is less than equal to 10 means if the value become 
	10 is also true na 10<=10 
	thats why it print 10 also 
	but we have to check the condtion to change condtion to i<10 
	means if the value is 10<10 is getting false 


corrected code : this code will print 1 to 9
public class OffByOneErrorForLoop {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
			System.out.println(i);
		}
	}
}
