Snippet 8:
public class OffByOneDoWhileLoop {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num = 1;
		do {
			System.out.println(num);
			num--;
		} while (num > 0);
	}
}
// Error to investigate: 
Why does this loop print unexpected numbers?
	because in the d0{} body we decrement the value of num so it goes to -1..
	and the while condition we  check num>0 means -1>0 it get false
	and only single 1 is print


 What adjustments are needed to print the numbers from 1 to 5?

	first we have to make increment of num ie. num++ and then 
	in condition we have to write num<=5 then it will give output 1 to 5

corrected code:

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num = 1;
		do {
			System.out.println(num);
			num++;
		} while (num <= 5);
	}
}
