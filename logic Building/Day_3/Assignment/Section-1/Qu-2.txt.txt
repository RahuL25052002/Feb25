Snippet 2:
public class IncorrectWhileCondition {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int count = 5;
		while (count = 0) {
		System.out.println(count);
		count--;
		}
	}
}
// Error to investigate: Why does the loop not execute as expected? What is the issue with the condition in the
`while` loop?

in the loop we have assign the value to count means count become 0
but compiler need Boolean value but here is integer value that's why 
it get compile error

corrected code 

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int count = 5;
		while (count == 0) {
		System.out.println(count);
		count--;
		}
	}
}

int the condition we have compare count==0 it get false value
