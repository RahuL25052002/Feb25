Snippet 6:
public class MisplacedForLoopBody {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
			System.out.println(i);
		System.out.println("Done");
	}
}

// Error to investigate: 

Why does "Done" print only once, outside the loop? 
	because it is outside the loop we dont gave body to for loop so it will consider that it very next to statement to it 
s	only one statement it will consider that so it can run the loop execute only next statement to it 
	here compiler find out there is no given body do it think he have to execute only one statement 
	so thats why it not execute the second statement in loop 
	when loop ended the next statement also run and code end 


How should the loop body be enclosed to	include all statements within the loop?	
	we have to give the loop body in the loop body every statement will excute in loop wise 


corrected code it will excecute all statement in the for loop body have	
public class MisplacedForLoopBody {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
			System.out.println(i);
			System.out.println("Done");
		}
	}
}
