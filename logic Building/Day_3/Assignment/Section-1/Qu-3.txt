Snippet 3:
public class DoWhileIncorrectCondition {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num = 0;
		do {
			System.out.println(num);
			num++;
		} while (num > 0);
	}
}
// Error to investigate: 

Why does the loop only execute once? 
	No, it will infinite loop
What is wrong with the loop condition in the `dowhile`
loop?
	it will goes in infinte loop because first num=0;
	then it goes to do body it print num value and increment by 1
	and then it goes to condtion here condition is num>0
	now num is 1 then 1>0 is true then it again goes to do body print 
	and increment by 1 ... so on 
	thats why condtion never get false 

corrected code:
public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num = 0;
		do {
			System.out.println(num);
			num++;
		} while (num < 0);
	}
}

now it will run only once and print 0
