Good question! 🚀  
When it comes to **Algorithms and Data Structures** in interviews (especially for software roles), interviewers usually ask about **three things**:

1. **Understanding** — Do you know the basic concepts?
2. **Problem Solving** — Can you apply them to solve coding problems?
3. **Optimization** — Can you write efficient code (time/space complexity)?

Here’s a detailed breakdown of what they often **ask**:

# 📚 What They Ask About Algorithms & Data Structures:

## 📗 Data Structures Basics

- What is an array? When would you use it?
- What is a linked list? Singly vs Doubly Linked List?
- What is a stack? Applications?
- What is a queue? Types: normal queue, circular queue, deque, priority queue?
- What is a hash table (or hashmap)? How does it work internally?
- What is a binary tree? What are different types of binary trees?
- What is a binary search tree (BST)? Properties?
- What is a heap? Max-Heap vs Min-Heap?
- What is a graph? Directed vs undirected graphs? Representation (adjacency list/matrix)?
- What is a trie (prefix tree)?
- What are sets and maps?

## 📘 Algorithms Basics

- What is sorting? What are the common sorting algorithms?
  - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
- Time complexities of sorting algorithms?
- What is searching? Binary search vs linear search?
- What is recursion? Give examples.
- What is backtracking? Give examples (like solving a maze, N-Queens).
- What is dynamic programming (DP)? Basic examples?
- What is divide and conquer?
- What is greedy algorithm? Examples?
- What is memoization?
- What is the difference between BFS and DFS in a graph?

## 🧠 Problem Solving

They often **give you a real coding problem** based on:

- Arrays (e.g., find two numbers that add up to target — "Two Sum")
- Strings (e.g., longest substring without repeating characters)
- Linked Lists (e.g., reverse a linked list, detect a cycle)
- Trees (e.g., find the height of a tree, inorder traversal)
- Graphs (e.g., detect a cycle in a graph, shortest path)
- Stacks/Queues (e.g., implement a min-stack, parentheses matching)
- Hashing (e.g., count the number of unique elements)
- Dynamic Programming (e.g., Fibonacci number optimization, coin change problem)
- Sliding Window problems (e.g., maximum sum subarray)
- Binary Search problems (e.g., find element in a rotated sorted array)

## 📋 Bonus: Common Quick Theory Questions

- What is Big-O notation? Give examples.
- What is the time complexity of searching in a BST?
- What is the space complexity of DFS?
- Difference between iterative and recursive approaches?
- How would you optimize a recursive solution?
- How would you detect and handle collisions in a hash table?
- How would you find shortest path in a graph (Dijkstra's Algorithm)?
- Explain merge sort and quick sort.

# 🏆 Summary:
**In short**, you need to know:
- **Definitions** — what is it, how does it work
- **Applications** — when and why to use it
- **Code** — how to implement it
- **Complexity** — how efficient it is

If you want, I can also make you a **full practice sheet** with **top 50 DSA questions** that interviewers love to ask, and even **mark difficulty level** (easy/medium/hard). 🚀

Would you like me to prepare that too? 🎯
