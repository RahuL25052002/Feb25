Balanced Tree

balancess search tree
height balance tree

1. Avl tree
2. 2-3 tree
3. 2-3-4 tree
4. B trees B+ trees
5. Red-black tree

===========================================================

AVL TREE
- Adleson -Velsky-Landis three legends
-height balance tree -search tree
use a terminology balance factor{0,+-1};-1,0,1
-balance factore=height of left subtree- height of right subtree-Evry BST properties is applicable to AVL
-insertion, deletion and search=> O(logn)
evry leaf node balance factore is (0) zero.
BF(b)=h(LST)-h(RST)

what to study?
array
stack
queue
circular queue
linked list
DLL

Non-linear
Trees
-BT
-BST
-AVL
-Read & black

Graph
directed and undirected graph
traversal BFS  and DFS

Spanning  tree
MST
weighted MST
Kruskal and prims
Shortest path
dijesktra algorithm 
flody marshal
bellman ford

and  prepare time complexity

Linked list is  very important

Deletion/  Doublly linkedlist
Application  of queue  and stack
Dynammic of Application of Array
-Recursion
-Backtracking
-brute and force
-divide and conquer (merge and quick sort)
-greedy techiniques(min max) heap or priority queue
-dynammc programming
